There is an opportunity to do a workshop at EAGx India. For the topic, Harshit and I are inclining towards something like 'resolving inner conflict'.

But why talk about this? Let's list out some reasons:

1. A lot of movements towards better decision making, thinking and doing involves resolving inner conflicts instead of forcing one part's opinion down others' throats. Inner harmony will likely lead to more sustainable plans and actions towards those plans.
2. Useful frames to better understand inner dynamics. Techniques like IFS, Focusing, IDC etc provide useful frames to slow down, look at and understand what's happening at the subjective level. Multiple agents wanting some space to have their say. Wanting to be genuinely listened to. This feels obviously useful for mental health maintenance in general.
3. Therapeutic work in this topic feels closest to something that can be done independently without paying lots of money to external therapist. Exploring novel ways to do this work and spreading the word for existing methods seems useful.
4. I personally want to do more of this work! "Teaching is the best form of learning" and all that.

So what will actually happen at this workshop?

Larger goal- Give an introduction to frameworks for **observing, working with and resolving** inner conflicts within our minds for better decision making and emotional regulation.

We are still evaluating what pedagogy/UI makes the most sense given it is a one-off session. Here are some example workshops:

A.

1. Start with an activity that uses a version of Internal Double Crux (IDC) to get people working on a problem or conflict they have in their lives.
2. A few slides talking about sub-agent model of mind and the neuroscientific evidence behind it (and evolutionary perspective)
3. Goodharting within the human mind and a small workshop on how to identify it
4. Potential pitfalls when resolving inner conflict

B.

1. Activity that is a variant on IDC to resolve an inner conflict audience member has
2. Briefly talk about how some types of meditation help us with seeing inner conflict dynamic more clearly
3. Discuss - procrastination/akrasia being a manifestation of sub-agent disagreement
4. Cautions associated with over-using this framework

C.

1. Same as above
2. brief discussion about sub-agents and different therapeutic techniques that use this framework to resolve inner-conflict
3. brief discussion on whether emotional healing is a pre-requisite for Rationality or how inner-work is a necessary ingredient for healthier rationality
4. When not to use this framework
