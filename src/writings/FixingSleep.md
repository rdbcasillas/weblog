# Changing Sleep Pattern

There is a strange feeling that I notice when I am sleep deprived. I feel like wanting to sleep and not sleep at the same time. The head feels heavier. Thoughts are a bit foggy. They don't move around smoothly and they are under lesser control than usual.

I don't think I am chronically sleep deprived. But it happens often enough that I should be looking for techniques to reduce it as much as possible.

The first question to ask here: Do I want to _go to sleep_ at a particular point in time? Or do I want to keep things flexible? Do I at least have a range in mind? Between 12:30am and 2:30am? This is the range within which I usually _go to sleep_.

I would like to try a smaller range. Between 11:30pm and 12:30am. Yeah, would like to try this for few weeks and see what happens. I feel like trying earlier sleeping time for multiple reasons:

- Overlap more time spent with I
- Wake up early and write. How does it feel to write first thing in the morning? I have vague memories of it being a fun experience (over 10 years ago)
- Reduced sleep deprived feeling

For this to happen, I will have to eat my dinner earlier. Science recommend 2-3 hours before sleep which kinda happens right now but that's only because I go to sleep around 2:30am. So in order to try the earlier sleeping times, I will have to finish dinner by 10pm.

Another thing that needs to happen is blocking apps on the phone at a fixed time (like 11pm) so I can't open distractions when unable to immediately sleep. It's insane how quickly I sometimes grab my phone if i don't fall asleep within a minute of lying down.

But why is my sleep broken in the first place? I think the main reason is simple. I hate going to sleep. If it was not unhealthy, I would never go to sleep. I enjoy lying down and relaxing of course. But proper sleep, especially at night, feels like a waste of time. Not that I am utilizing my day time very efficiently but that's a separate concern.

I really enjoy the peacefulness of night and the idea of just going to sleep instead of cherishing that peace doesn't feel right.

But I have enjoyed this night time peace for about 15 years so there's no harm in trying something different for a few weeks.
