There is an opportunity to do a workshop at EAGx India. For the topic, Harshit and I are inclining towards something like 'resolving inner conflict'. 

But why talk about this? Let's list out some reasons: 
1. A lot of movements towards better decision making, thinking and doing involves resolving inner conflicts instead of forcing one part's opinion down  others' throats. Inner harmony will likely lead to more sustainable plans and actions towards those plans. 
2. Useful frames to better understand inner dynamics. Techniques like IFS, Focusing, IDC etc provide useful frames to slow down, look at and understand what's happening at the subjective level. Multiple agents wanting some space to have their say. Wanting to be genuinely listened to. This feels obviously useful for mental health maintenance in general. 
3. Therapeutic work in this topic feels closest to something that can be done independently without paying lots of money to external therapist. Exploring novel ways to do this work and spreading the word for existing methods seems useful. 
4. I personally want to do more of this work! "Teaching is the best form of learning" and all that.
