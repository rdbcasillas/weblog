# Value Discovery

This post documents my explorations with discovering values. It is not a coherent linear essay or article. It is me reading bunch of resources, playing with them and curating that experience by writing my notes in a single post. It may or may not become more readable in future. It is almost never fully complete, which is why the tag _evergreen_.

### Chapter from sfsd book:

Source: [Writing Out a Value](https://textbook.sfsd.io/4/writing-out-a-value)
Writing values doesn't necessarily mean your actions will be aligned with them. BUT! It may still be useful to write them:

- Communicate to others what's important to you
- Find people with shared values
- For a project to set clear objectives
- Inspire others who don't have that value but realize after reading that it would be fun to have it
  _Values are NOT_:
- Feeling or experience - they happen to you.
- Goal - goals are about specific outcomes, values are about expressing something in your actions.
- Internalized norm or cultural moral fad

#### 3 parts of a value

1. The Context
2. The Attentional Policy
3. Source of Meaning

Form: In {CONTEXT X} {ATTEND TO A, B, C} so that {SOURCE OF MEANING}.

Example: When sitting in front of my computer, I want to have a clarity of goal/purpose, so that I can feel more in control of my time (so I can feel more agentic and top of things)

Here, the values is coming up in a very specific context. Sitting in front of my computer with no purpose and opening random (or habitual) websites isn't something I enjoy doing. I have done that enough already, want to try something different for a while and see what happens.

Now, the attentional policy here is : "have clarity of goal/purpose". What am I attending to here? Paying attention to : "Do i know what I am doing here for the next few minutes? Next few hours?"
If not, do I value knowing that while I am sitting in front of the computer? Of course, having the clarity includes spending time on playing games or watching tennis or youtube. But a gentle nudge everytime I sit in front of my computer: "what brings me here?" can help me feel more agentic. Feeling agentic in that context has higher change of making me feel happy as noticed in the past.
