# The joy of creating a digital garden

There is something about putting stuff in public that is enjoyable to me. I am not talking about stuff like tweets or comments on reddit though. Those can be fun and important but they aren't what I have in mind.

I mean throwing stuff in public on my own digital garden. My own digital space that I have created and I am responsible for maintaining and nurturing. Like my [previous Github pages website](https://rdbcasillas.github.io). I wrote articles, blogs and posted monthly links there. Whenever I would go there and look at my postings, I would get a sense of pride. This is my work. It's probably silly and trivial. But it is my work published on my own space. Although less intense, I get similar feeling when i go to my [current personal website](https://vatsalmehra.com) even though it is mostly a resume (Fuck you Linkedin!).

I can never get that feeling by looking at bunch of my tweets or reddit comments or even thoughtful postings on substack. They flatten all uniqueness.

All of my previous personal blogs or websites were made using existing templates. This time I want to start with an empty land. I want to design my own garden from scratch. This web designing might distract me from putting thoughtful creative content out there but that's ok initially. I want to be excited about designing the garden that acts as a container for all types of weird plants I want to plant. I want people to come to a unique place and feel intrigued. Substack or Medium ain't that. I want them to not just engage with writing but also lightly engage with the website itself. This doesn't necessarily mean the website will be filled with interactive elements. But the website should leave some pleasant mark on their memory. Something that makes them go "Hmm, interesting place. I should bookmark this".

So what kind of plants am I interested in planting? Not sure really. It will depend on stuff I am consuming, experiencing and building. There will be lots of writing of course. But there would be other ways of expressing too like videos, podcasts or drawings. The goal is of course to continue to be excited about life and share the excitement with the world. The medium for sharing could come in any form.

Somedays I might just ramble. But I enjoy looking at my old ramblings. They act as a time machine to get in touch with my younger self. How did the younger V see the world? What was he naive about? Static photos can't capture that. Rough thoughts in the form of writing can. Journaling is not only useful for lightening your mind in the present moment but also to go back and get to know your younger self.

I am also curious about co-creating with friends and post it on this website. Co-working with H or I, whether in the form of simple feedback or Lennon-McCartney style should be an interesting experiment. When Beatles's greatest songs with small and simple lyrics can be the result of brainstorming between two passionate singers, why can't that dynamic be replicated for small articles posted here? I genuinely think this is an underrated strategy that would make a lot of people a lot more creative. We just don't have the spaces designed to encourage this kind of collaborative creation.

Hopefully Portal can be one such space.
